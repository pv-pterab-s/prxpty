* logging and reporting

be able to record & playback traffic for further automated validation

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    # record
    prxpty -or 'log COR.log' prxpty -os 'log SOS.log' bash

    # playback
    cmp <(play SOS.log | DBG=all encode | DBG=all decode) SOR.log

    # measure
    play SOS.log | DBG=stdin encode | log enc.log

    # report
    log2sizes SOS.log > SOS.log.sizes
    log2sizes enc.log > enc.log.sizes
    plot SOS.log.sizes enc.log.sizes # etc...
#+END_EXAMPLE

once can measure, measure all strategies we come up with

building gui bits... render two consoles and merge the two together? could use
testing to make sure things are correct? might make things repeatable

recording produces data perhaps for ai analysis

** exp dir
*** plot <file>    (gnuplot: chronological depiction)
*** ratios <file0> <file1>
*** report calls the above
*** each experiment calls back to generate the report
** log2len <file>  (number per line)
** play <file>
** log <file>      (logs and passthru)
** debug.ls logging api
